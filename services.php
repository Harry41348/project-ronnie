                            the final design. The options offered include: wooden fences in parts or 
                            timbered, fences hung between concrete posts, mesh fences made from grids,

                            At least 1m wide and can even enter the garden through a standard sized garden door. 
                            For ergonomic reasons, as many operations as possible (such as excavation) are 
                            carried out by machines. If this is not possible, so-called "hand excavation" is 
                            done. Disposal materials, as well as soil, are usually disposed of by container. If 
                            it concerns small quantities, which are often excavated "by hand", then we have

                            the most important factor within the boundaries of landscaping. Today, the 
                            possibilities of paving are virtually endless. This in accordance with dimensions, 
                            colors and applicability. Advice is given in the design. To determine in which 
                            atmosphere the garden should be designed, the paving is a dominant interpretation 
                            in the whole. We have the knowledge and equipment to offer almost any form of 
                            paving. Whether this is a simple piece of pavement with clinkers, or a terrace 
                            laid of natural stone in stabilized sand, or a sand cement bed lined with hard 
                            joints.</p>

                            gardens. A garden can be considerably enriched by a simple pergola or a hardwood 
                            deck. A pergola is a relatively inexpensive way to provide rapid progress: ie, 
                            spatial enlargement. A pergola overgrown with beautiful climbing plants in bloom 
                            is a pleasure to look at. Decks are the ideal solution for a patio by the water or 
                            a place where you would prefer paving, but not made of stone. We also offer 
                            verandas. Ready-made, or designed, with or without roof tiles in a variety of 
                            materials. A veranda is often reminiscent of the front of a house, but it is great 
                            to have a veranda in the garden, where you can enjoy peace and quiet even in bad 
                            weather conditions. The foregoing also applies to garden houses or log cabins;we 
                            can provide you with all wishes and choices.</p>

                            otherwise never reside in your garden. We make ponds in all shapes and sizes. This 
                            entirely according to your wishes. Sleek and modern, or round and natural. To keep 
                            the water in optimal condition, we have the knowledge and technology by applying 
                            filter systems and UV lamps. Something that is increasingly seen in the cage carp 
                            pond, because these fish often eat the plants that keep the pond in good condition.</p>

                            the garden and ensures that all other elements come together in harmony. It may 
                            take some time before the desired design result is visible. The initial situation 
                            is always drawn in the design, because plants need time to grow. A planting plan 
                            is always included with a garden design, containing the names and any special
